		review: 'Can\'t get over the extreme level of compassion both myself and pup were shown while in the office. I felt as comfortable as I could in an otherwise stressful situation and felt the vets took great care of my pup! The way your staff listened to my concerns, dug deeper into the issue at hand and how they treated my pup!'
